field: Software Engineering Manager, Senior Software Engineer

intro: |
  I am a Senior Software Engineer and Engineering Manager with more than 10
  years of industry experience in a wide variety of areas.

  I'm a specialist in UI web development, and also have broad experience in the
  different skills involved in software engineering and delivering products,
  UIs, APIs and infrastructure, effectively and producing maintainable software.

  As a manager I strive for providing clear direction, trust and autonomy to my
  reports so that they can execute on the team and organization's objectives as
  effectively as possible, while developing professionally and advancing their
  careers.

  I enjoy computer generated art, compilers and programming languages, UI design
  and development, and exploring new technologies that grow the way we think
  about solving problems.

  I currently work for the Wikimedia Foundation on open source and open
  knowledge as an Engineering Manager for the Product Infrastructure team.
