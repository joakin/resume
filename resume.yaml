intro: |
  I've given a workshop on Clojurescript for the FutureJS conference
  (April - May 2014), materials are online:

  * [FutureJS site](http://futurejs.org/workshops/diving-into-clojurescript)
  * [Slides](http://slides.com/joakino/diving-into-clojurescript/)
  * [GitHub repo - Exercises and explanations](https://github.com/joakin/diving-into-clojurescript-exercises/)

  I've enjoy reading technical books, developing random side projects and
  learning and exploring new technologies that interest me, ranging from front
  end development, to backend coding and databases, and finally systems
  administration.

  Things I've been interested and diving into in the last year include:

  Clojure and Clojurescript, Functional programming, Node.js, React.js,
  JavaScript (ES6), Promises (standalone and with generators), CSP (Generators
  and channels, core.async), Coffeescript, several HTML5 APIs, Couchdb, Ansible
  (system administration)

  For a sample of code, here are some of my last side projects I open sourced:

  * [ClojureScript snake game](https://github.com/joakin/cnake)
  * [Coffee node cli for organizing photos](https://github.com/joakin/galeria-cli)
