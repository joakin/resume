          While freelance contracting for OHIM, I went mainly through two
          different big projects, OHIM eSearch (JS web application) and the new
          OHIM Website (public site and suite of web tools).

          #### eSearch

          application using Javascript, CSS3 with LESS, Backbone. This
          application got to about 25KLOC of code.
